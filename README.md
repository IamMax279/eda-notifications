# Event Driven Notification System #

## This is just a simple Spring Boot project that utilizes RabbitMQ and Resend API - when a user gets registered, a message is sent to the email service which then sends a confirmation email to the user. ##

## Disclaimer ##
### Before running the app, you must first fill in the missing fields in the docker-compose file and each service's application.properties file (e.g. postgres db credentials) ###
